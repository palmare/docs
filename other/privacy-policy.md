Palmare (PAL) Limited, its subsidiaries, parent companies, affiliates, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership (collectively, “**we**”, “**our**”, or “**us**”) take our users’ (“**users**” or “**you**”) privacy rights seriously.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, disclose and manage the personal information (“**Personal Information**”) you provide to us when using, or about to using, any of our applications, games or software (collectively, the “**Services**”). Whenever you access or use our website and domain name, and any of the Services, you agree to allow us to collect, use, store, disclose and manage your Personal Information as explained in this Privacy Policy, and accept this Privacy Policy in registration or game installation.

We have the right to amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of your information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.

**Personal Information and Non-Personal Information**

We collect both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. “Personal Information” is information about you that can be used to identify or contact you on-line or off-line, such as your name, birth date, home address, email address, credit card information and phone number. “Personal information” may include your unique device or user identifier when the identifier is combined with your personal information. “Non-Personal Information” is information that, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you personally and can include gender, age or interests and cannot be used to connect with you. This Privacy Policy does not restrict or limit our collection of aggregate information or Non-Personal Information.

Personal information also does not include “aggregate information”. Aggregate information is data we collect about the characteristics and activities of the users and visitors of the Services and enhance our Services and our sites, from which any Personal Information has been removed. Such information may include demographic information, such as your unique user or user identifier (when not matched with or tie to your Personal Information), city of residence, information about your computer, software, platform and Internet IP address. We collect aggregate information about the use of the Services to provide the best possible service and allow us to make certain recommendations and internal reports and share such information with our partners about how our customers use the Services so that our partners also understand how people use the Services and they can provide you with an optimal user experience.

We may combine Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to be used to improve your experience with or to aggregate it with information collected from other users to improve or analyze the Services.

**Policies Regarding Children Under The Age of 13**

Please note that this “Policies Regarding Children Under the Age of 13” section only applies to procedures when collecting information from children under the age of 13.

We recognise the obligation to protect Personal Information obtained from young children. The Services are not geared toward children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from such children other than those stated in this section. If we collect any personal information (as defined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“**COPPA**”), which was established by U.S. Congress to protect children’s online privacy) from children under the age of 13, we will either (1) comply with the requirements of COPPA and gain prior verifiable parental consent or direct parental notification of the nature and intended use of such information, which shall include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity; or (2) take all reasonable steps to promptly remove from our files and records such information. For more information about COPPA and children’s rights to online privacy, please visit the Children’s Privacy section of the Federal Trade Commission’s website at www.business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/childrens-privacy.

In addition, we advise that children over the age of 13 shall ask their parents for permission before transmitting any of their information to anyone over the Internet, and we suggest parents to tell their children not to provide their personal information, without permission, when using the Internet.

\
_**What types of information do we collect from children?**_

We mainly collect persistent identifier (such as an IP address, mobile device id, or a unique device identifier) from the child.

Please note that all sites that are directed to children under the age of 13 are prohibited by COPPA from conditioning a child’s participation in an online activity on the child’s disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.

\
_**How do we use and share the personal information collected from children?**_

We use the collected persistent identifier for the sole purpose of providing support for internal operations of the Service, including activities necessary for us to maintain or analyze the functioning of the Services, authenticate users or personalize content, serve contextual advertising or cap the frequency of advertising, protect the security or integrity of the user or the Service, or ensure legal or regulatory compliance.

The collected persistent identifier is not shared with other third parties. However, we may, from time to time contract with certain third party service providers to provide support for the internal operations of the Service. Your personal information is not used or disclosed by these contracted third party service providers except for the limited service for which they have been contracted.

We collect a child’s email address in connection with a question emailed to us by the child for the sole purpose of communicating with the child on a one-time-only basis (e.g. responding to a question from the child). We will not use or disclose such information to re-contact the child or for any other purpose, and such information will be deleted from our records promptly after responding to the child’s request. If we choose not to respond to the child’s request, we will immediately delete the child’s information.

\
_**How can parents review or delete personal information about their child?**_

At any time, parents of children under the age of 13 may review or delete personal information about their children from our records, or refuse to permit our further collection or use of such personal information. Please contact us at **compliance@palmare.io** if you would like to review or delete your child’s personal information, or to inform us about your refusal to permit our further collection of such personal information.

Whenever a parent requests a deletion of his or her child’s personal information, we will use reasonable efforts to delete the child’s information from our records as much as possible and will not collect any other personal information from such child. Please note that there may be residual information that will remain in our records that may or may not contain the personal information that was requested to be deleted. Such residual information will not be disclosed or shared with any other third party or used for any commercial purpose.

\
_**Changes in our Privacy Policy Regarding Children Under the Age of 13?**_

We may amend our Privacy Policy Regarding Children Under the Age of 13 at any time. We will provide parents notice by e-mail of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share a child’s personal information. Please note that, at all times, parents should update their personal information to provide us current e-mail addresses. We will apply material changes in our Privacy Policy Regarding Children Under the Age of 13 only in conformance with applicable law, including any applicable provisions of COPPA that require parental consent.
