**LAST UPDATED: 1 MAY 2022**

Welcome to palmate.io (the “Site”) owned and operated by Palmare (PAL) Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (collectively, “Palmare,” “we,” “our”, or “us”). Palmare provides an online service to play an NFT game (the “Service”). The terms “you,” “your,” and “yours” refer to anyone accessing, viewing, browsing, visiting or using the Site and/ or the Service.

These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you“) and Palmare (PAL) Limited (“we“, “us“, or “our“) concerning your access to and use of the [**www.palmare.io**](https://www.thedustland.com/) website and the Palmare cyclist app as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site“ and the “App“).

WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE AND/OR ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SITE, THE APP AND THE SMART CONTRACTS AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

Palmare is a distributed application that is intended to run on the BSC Network and such other networks as we may select from time to time (the “Blockchain Networks“), using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a “Smart Contract”) to enable users to own PAL tokens and Palmare NFTs (collectively with the PAL tokens, the “Palmare Tokens”), transfer Palmare Tokens, and play missions.

Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site, the App, and the Smart Contracts from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference.

You will be subject to and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of the Site, the App, and the Smart Contracts after the date such revised Terms of Use are posted.

The information on the Site, the App, and the Smart Contracts are not intended for distribution to any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation, or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, any persons who access the Site and/or the App while breaking their local laws are doing it on their own initiative and will have to deal with the consequences when applicable.

The Site is intended for users who are at least 18 years old. People under the age of 18 are not permitted to use or register for the Site, the App, and the Smart Contracts.

**5. FEE AND PAYMENT**

Any purchases from the site or marketplace will be done through smart contracts on a Blockchain using an electronic wallet like Metamask or such other electronic wallets as we may permit from time to time (the “Electronic Wallets”). Any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Blockchain via an Electronic Wallet. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the Site and/or the App or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Blockchain Networks.

BSC (and other Blockchain Networks) require the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Blockchain Network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Blockchain network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.

As between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with your use of the App (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, or sales of any of your tokens and assets). Except for income taxes levied on Palmare, you: (i) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local, or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value-added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (ii) shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms.

You agree and acknowledge that we have made the Site, the App and the Smart contracts available to you and entered into these terms in reliance upon the warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability set forth herein, which reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk between the parties and form an essential basis of the bargain between us. We would not be able to provide the site, the app and the smart contracts to you without these limitations.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, and some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so the above limitations may not apply to personal injury claims.

\
**14. ASSUMPTION OF RISK**

You accept and acknowledge each of the following:

A. The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile.

We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of Palmare Tokens will not lose money.

B. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Palmare-related transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.

C. The App does not store, send, or receive Palmare Tokens. This is because Palmare Tokens exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App’s supporting blockchain on the Blockchain Networks. Any transfer of Palmare Tokens occurs only on the Blockchain Networks.

D. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your Electronic Wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the networks, however caused.

E. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the Palmare ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Palmare Tokens.

F. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Palmare ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Palmare Tokens.

\
**15. INDEMNIFICATION**

We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void, and unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable these Terms of Use and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms of Use or use of the Site. You agree that these Terms of Use will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Use.
