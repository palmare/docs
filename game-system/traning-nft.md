# Gear NFT

### Gear Types

There are four Gear types, each designed to suit a different exercise intensity and/or fitness level:

| **Name**    | **Max level** | **Base Return at Optimal Calories Burned** |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Casual**  | 5             | 10  PAS / 1 Energy spent                   |
| **Trainer** | 8             | 15 PAS / 1 Energy spent                    |
| **Warrior** | 12            | 20 PAS / 1 Energy spent                    |
| **Racer**   | 16            | 25 PAS / 1 Energy spent                    |

Usersâ€™ base PAS return is not static, and several factors may cause it to fluctuate:

1. Gear Level
2. Gear Type
3. Gear Quality
4. Profile Level (you can upgrade your profile level by spend PAS earn through trainng)
5. Randomization.

Information on PAS/PAL Return rates will be provided in future updates.

### Gear Quality

There are five Gear qualities. When a Gear is minted, the value of each Attribute will be chosen at random within the min. and max. values according to Gear quality. As such, even Gear of the same quality may have vastly different Attribute distributions.

| Quality       | Min. Attribute | Max. Attribute |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **Common**    | 1              | 3              |
| **Uncommon**  | 6              | 14             |
| **Rare**      | 15             | 35             |
| **Epic**      | 28             | 63             |
| **Legendary** | 45             | 95             |

### Bicycle Level

Users can level up their Bicycles by burning **PAS**. Each level-up takes a fixed time to complete, which increases along with the amount of **PAS** required according to the Bicycle level. This process can be sped up by using even more **PAS**.

Additionally, **PAL** will also be required to level Epic & Legendary Bicycle to Max Level.

| Quality       | PAL/PAS Multiplies |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| **Common**    | x1                 |
| **Uncommon**  | x1.1               |
| **Rare**      | x1.2               |
| **Epic**      | x1.3               |
| **Legendary** | x1.4               |
