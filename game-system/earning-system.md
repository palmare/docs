# Earning System

### Energy System

Energy replenishes 25% every 6 hours until it reaches the Energy Cap. Users start with one Gear and 2 Energy Caps. Users can increase their max. Energy by holding more Gears. The calculation is as follows:

| **Gear No.** | **Energy** | **Train & earn time (min)** | **Note**     |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1            | 2          | 10                          | Newbie       |
| 3            | 4          | 20                          | Daily User   |
| 9            | 9          | 45                          | Savvied User |
| 15           | 12         | 60                          | Pro User     |
| 30           | 20         | 100                         | Athlete      |

Additional Energy (cumulative) is given to users for higher Quality Bicycles:

1. Owning an Uncommon Gear: +1 Energy
2. Owning a Rare Gear: +2 Energy
3. Owning an Epic Gear: +3 Energy
4. Owning a Legendary Gear: +4 Energy

**EXAMPLE 1:**

1 Uncommon Gear + 1 Common Gear = 3 Total Energy (2 Base Energy + 1 Bonus)

**EXAMPLE 2:**

2 Rare Gear + 1 Common Gear = 8 Total Energy (4 Base Energy + 4 Bonus)
