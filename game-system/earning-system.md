# Earning System

### Energy System

Energy replenishes 25% every 6 hours until it reaches the Energy Cap. Users start with one Bicycle and 2 Energy Caps. Users can increase their max. Energy by holding more Bicycles. The calculation is as follows:



| **Bicycles No.** | **Energy** | **Ride & earn time (min)** | **Note**     |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1                | 2          | 10                         | Newbie       |
| 3                | 4          | 20                         | Daily User   |
| 9                | 9          | 45                         | Savvied User |
| 15               | 12         | 60                         | Pro User     |
| 30               | 20         | 100                        | Athlete      |

Additional Energy (cumulative) is given to users for higher Quality Bicycles:

1. Owning an Uncommon Bicycle: +1 Energy
2. Owning a Rare Bicycle: +2 Energy
3. Owning an Epic Bicycle: +3 Energy
4. Owning a Legendary Bicycle: +4 Energy

**EXAMPLE 1:**

1 Uncommon Bicycle + 1 Common Bicycle = 3 Total Energy (2 Base Energy + 1 Bonus)

**EXAMPLE 2:**

2 Rare Bicycle + 1 Common Bicycle = 8 Total Energy (4 Base Energy + 4 Bonus)
