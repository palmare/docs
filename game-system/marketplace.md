# Marketplace

The Marketplace is where users can rent/lease or sell/buy their NFT Bicycles, Badges, and Trainer Profile. A simple filter and sort function is available in the Marketplace for easy navigation.

The 2% Marketplace Trading Fee is reserved to use case below:

### Trade Fee

Trade fees are collected by a smart contract and then distributed as follows:

* 25% is given to the designated wallets of the PAL stakers & LP providers. This allows us to attract more LP providers.
* 50% is burned. This will continuously increase the value of PAL by implementing a consistent burn mechanic and deflating the supply.
* 25% will be sent to the Quest Fund to reward our community and players.
