### Rental System (Coming Soon)

The main barrier we face to onboarding new users into a Crypto-related game is the complexity of the onboarding process. This starts with creating an Exchange Account, converting fiat to Cryptocurrency, and navigating Web 3.0 with a Decentralized Wallet. Palmare aims to breach this barrier by introducing a Rental System.

By offering a smart rent/lease system, getting started is as easy as downloading the app and renting a Bicycle, ensuring that new users will not be deterred from exploring the game.

Users looking to rent can head to the in-app Marketplace. They will need to apply for a rental, and after being paired with a leaser, will need to fully agree to the leaser’s rental terms before the rental is approved. Each rental contract lasts for 24 hours, after which the Bicycle will be returned to the owner for repair.

A Rental Agreement can stretch up to 7 days based on a renter’s credit rating. Failure to fulfill the terms stipulated in the Rental Agreement will result in a 1-star deduction from the renter’s credit rating.

Whenever a renter completes a session in the Single Mode, the Smart Contract will distribute the earnings following the Rental Agreement. The renter and lease earnings are fixed (TBD). The system will reward renters with 0.1 credit per successful Rental Agreement fulfilled.
