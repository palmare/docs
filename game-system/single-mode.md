# Single Mode

### Single Mode

In Single Mode, users are equipped with NFT bicycles to earn tokens by riding. Energy is needed to earn PAS tokens. Every 1 Energy equals 5 minutes of ride & earn movement and Energy which ONLY starts replenishing after users acquire an NFT Bicycle. To begin, users select a Bicycle of their choice, and press **Start button** ▶

Users should see a status on the top of the screen showing either **Casual** or **Practice**.

**Freezing**: This will be shown if the app detects a weak GPS/internet signal, or the user is not organically moving (i.e. using an electronic scooter or strap phone on their dog). No PAS will be earned while Freezing, and users may/may not lose Energy depending on the circumstance.

**GPS Signal**: White - No GPS; Red - Poor GPS; Green - Strong GPS.&#x20;

Always make sure you have Energy before moving, as there is no token earning if you have zero Energy.

**PAS/PAL** will be paid out for every minute of movement, which is dependent on 4 main factors:

1. **Type of Bicycle** - Base **PAS** returns for each Bicycle differs. Refer to the **Bicycle Attributes** section for the individual breakdown of each Bicycle type.\

2. **Bicycle’s Efficiency Attribute** - The higher the efficiency, the more **PAS** earned per minute. Users can ONLY earn **PAS** from Level 0 to Level 29. At Level 30, users can choose to stay earning **PAS**, or switch to earning **PAL**. Users can switch between these two earning modes freely.                         \

3. **Bicycle’s Comfort Attribute** - The higher the comfort, the more **PAL** earned per minute. Users will have the option to choose between **PAS** and **PAL** earning at Level 30. Users can switch between these two earning modes freely. For PAL releasing detail, refer to the **Tokenomic** section.\

4. **Speed of Movement** - To maximize earnings, users should keep within the optimal speed range of their respective Bicycle. Whenever a user falls below or above this range, their earnings will be reduced up to 90% depending on the speed discrepancy from the optimal range.&#x20;

Once Energy is depleted, users stop earning tokens. They can either choose to carry on tracking their movements, or manually exit Single Mode by briefly holding down the **Stop** button.

### &#x20;**Mystery Chest**

Mystery Chest is a loot box that is randomly dropped while you are moving in Single Mode. It contains Gems (Level 1 – 3). Each user has 4 Mystery Chest slots.

Mystery Chest has the same 5 quality types as Bicycle. Upon receiving a Mystery Chest, opening the chest requires waiting and the countdown starts automatically. Once the countdown ends, they will be able to open it. Mystery Chest countdown duration increases proportionately to its quality.

### Duel Mode (Under Development)

In Racing Mode, users need to register under the **Racing** Tab at least 24 hours before commencement. There will both be **Weekly Racings** and **Monthly Racings.**

1. **Weekly Racings** - These Racing are held weekly and last for the whole week. Users can choose to participate in the 5km, 10km, or 15km Racing, but can only take part in one Racing at a time.\

2. **Monthly Racings** - These Racing are held monthly and last for the whole month. Users can choose to participate in the 10km, 20km, or 30km Racing, but can only take part in one Racing at a time.

Only users who have successfully registered will receive a notification in their **Quest Log (Under Development)**. Users can utilize the **Set a Goal** function to keep track of their progress. Once the stipulated riding distance is completed, users will be notified via the **Quest Log** that the Racing is complete. Users will not be able to repair their Bicycles until the Racing is over.

### &#x20;Leaderboard (Coming Soon)

Racing participants are ranked using points. Points are calculated based on users’ riding speed and Bicycles Attributes.



### Rewards (Under Development)

1. The top % on the Leaderboard for the weekly/monthly Racing will receive PAS/PAL prizes and Gold NFT Badge (TBD)
2. The top % on the Leaderboard for the weekly/monthly Racing will receive PAL prizes and Silver NFT Badge (TBD)
3. The top % on the Leaderboard for the weekly/monthly Racing will receive PAS prizes and Bronze NFT Badge (TBD)
4. All Bicycle participants will receive an NFT Badge of Participation.



### Background Mode (Under Development)

While the Palmare app is not been actively used, users will be able to continue earning PAS. So long as the user holds a Bicycle in the app, Background Mode will count the steps directly from their mobile device’s Health Data app, capped at 5km daily. These earnings are fixed (not affected by Efficiency or other bonuses) and will not add to the daily PAS Cap.&#x20;

\


Users will not incur Durability or Energy costs while earning through Background Mode.
