# Bike Combination

### Bike-Combination

Bike-Combine Event (BCE) is when users use 2 Bicycles they own as a blueprint to “breed”, producing a higher rank bicycle in the process. For reference, the 2 Bicycles will be called Blueprints. Both Blueprints need to be in the user’s possession (not under lease) and have full durability to begin a BCE.

Users can then select a Bicycle, by heading to the **Combine** tab, choosing the Bicycle to combine with, and pressing **Combine** to proceed. The user will instantly receive a higher rank bicycle that can be used immediately.

After combination, the bicycles are used as blueprints will be burned immediately. The higher the rank a Bicycle has, the more PAS/PAL it will cost. Bike-Combine costs for each Blueprint are calculated separately and added together for the final Combination cost.

Bike-Combine has a 48-hour cool down for both Blueprints – Bicycles can still be used for movement.

### Bike-Combination Costs

1. Common – PAS
2. Uncommon – PAS
3. Rare – PAS + PAL
4. Epic – PAS + PAL
5. Legendary – PAS + PAL

The first two Shoe-Combine costs the same. Bike-Combine has a chance to drop one extra Mystery Chest. The higher the rank, the higher the chance to drop Mystery Chest.

Mystery Chest Quality is determined by the Blueprint Bicycle's Quality:

| **Blueprint 1 Quality** | **Blueprint 2 Quality** | **Common Chest %** | **Uncommon Chest %** | **Rare Chest %** | **Epic Shoebox %** | **Legendary Shoebox %** |

**Note: Epic Bicycle drop is disabled at the moment even there is 2% drop rate from Opening Rare Mystery Chest**

The new Bicycle type is determined by the two Vintage Bicycle types:

### Bike-Combination Variation

Bicycle Attributes are randomized according to their quality, regardless of their Vintage’s Attributes.
