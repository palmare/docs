# Anti - Cheat System

### Anti-Cheating System

Three mechanics are used to stop cheating in the game, which includes the cheater's account being punished:

* GPS tracking
* Motion sensor and health data
* Machine learning to detect cheating through data simulation

Using devices that have been jailbroken, rooted, or with an altered OS will result in Palmare not working properly.

Transferring Bicycle from one account to another account will result the Bicycle enters a Cooldown period, during Cooldown period, users cannot use this Bicycle.

If user loses energy because of transferring Bicycle from Inventory to the Wallet, all the unopened Mystery Chests on the user's account will be burned/purged.&#x20;

Note that losing energy by listing a Bicycle in the marketplace will **NOT**  burn/purge Mystery Chests.
