### **Leaderboards**

Leaderboards let trainers participate in new competitions within daily quests and challenge other players to beat their score. Trainers see how they rank among global players, as well as their friends. You can even create a friends-only leaderboard in your custom ride. Classic leaderboards are ongoing and maintain a player’s score forever. Use these to showcase scoring for overall or lifetime events, such as all-time number of matches won or the shortest time taken to complete a level.

### Achievements

In-Game Achievement is tied to each user's account. It is not on the Blockchain, but the Badge the user earned through completing Achievement is an NFT and can be earned by joining:

* Training Mode
* Challenge
* Duel Mode
* Daily Quests
* SocialFi's Club&#x20;
* Profile Level
* Trading&#x20;

### Challenges

Multiple trainers can connect through SocialFi Network and start multiplayer games together, see where others rank on a leaderboard, keep track Challenge score and get reward.

Let's go on missions together, display a custom leaderboard, and even show friends’ progress within progression maps. Trainers are prompted for access to their list of Challenge Center friends on a per-ride basis, so they always have control over sharing their activity.
