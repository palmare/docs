### **Leaderboards**

Leaderboards let cyclists participate in new competitions within your game and challenge other players to beat their score. Cyclists see how they rank among global players, as well as their friends. You can even create a friends-only leaderboard in your custom ride. Classic leaderboards are ongoing and maintain a player’s score forever. Use these to showcase scoring for overall or lifetime events, such as all-time number of matches won or the shortest time taken to complete a level.

### Achievements

In-Game Achievement is tied to each user's account. It is not on the Blockchain, but the Badge the user earned through completing Achievement is an NFT and can be earned by joining:

* Single Mode
* Challenge
* Adventure Mode
* Duel
* Social activities
* DAO&#x20;
* Collection
* Trading

### Friends

Challenge Center connects cyclists inside and outside of your ride. Players can start multiplayer games together, see where friends rank on a leaderboard, keep up with what their Challenge Center friends are doing on the Palmare app and in Challenge Center badges — and much more.

Let friends go on missions together, display a friends-only leaderboard, and even show friends’ progress within progression maps. Cyclists are prompted for access to their list of Challenge Center friends on a per-ride basis, so they always have control over sharing their activity.
