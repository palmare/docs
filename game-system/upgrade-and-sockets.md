# Upgrade & Sockets

### Gem Types and Level <a href="#gem-types-and-level" id="gem-types-and-level"></a>

Users are able to unlock Gem Sockets once their Bicycle reaches a certain level, and are able to enhance their Bicycle Attributes by inserting the corresponding Gems into the unlocked Sockets (i.e. only Efficiency Gems can be placed into Efficiency Sockets). There are four types of Gems, with each Gem representing an Attribute:

1. **Green:** Luck
2. **Blue:** Dexterity
3. **Red:** Strength
4. **Purple:** Endurance

By heading to the **Upgrade** tab under the **Gems** section, users can upgrade their Gems by burning **PAS** and combining 3 Gems of the same level and typing to a higher level (i.e three Level-1 Efficiency Gems to one Level-2 Efficiency Gem).**PAL** will also be required to upgrade a Gem from Level 4 onward. **Note: Low-level Gems Upgrade has a chance to fail.**

### Socket Types and Quality <a href="#socket-types-and-quality" id="socket-types-and-quality"></a>

A Bicycle has four different Sockets, identified by colors that match a Gem type. Users insert Gems into the Socket to boost the Bicycle's Attributes. One Socket is unlocked each time the Bicycle reaches levels 5, 10, 15, and 20 respectively. Higher Socket quality will give an extra boost to the inserted Gem's Attribute. Users will be able to see the Socket type without unlocking the socket, but NOT the Socket quality, which is determined by the Bicycle's quality
