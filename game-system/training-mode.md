# Training Mode

### Training Mode

In Traning Mode, users are equipped with NFT specific to their favorite sport to earn tokens by training. To earn token users need to burn calories in training and submit their result to socialfi network to verify their activity.\
\
In our first version app, we intergate cycling sport for cyclist community. Energy is needed to earn PAS tokens. Every 1 Energy equals 7 minutes of ride & earn movement and Energy which ONLY starts replenishing after users acquire an NFT Bicycle. To begin, users select a Bicycle of their choice, and press **Start button** â–¶

Always make sure you have Energy before training, as there is no token earning if you have zero Energy.

**PAS/PAL** will be paid out for every minute of movement, which is dependent on 4 main factors:

1. **Type of NFT** - Base **PAS** returns for each Bicycle differs. Refer to the **Bicycle** section for the individual breakdown of each Bicycle type.\

2. **Exercise Intensity** - To maximize earnings, users should keep within the training intensity (optimal speed range of their respective Bicycle). Base on your intensity, our app will calculate average calories burned and give out the Burn to Earn reward.&#x20;

Once Energy is depleted, users stop earning tokens. They can either choose to carry on training, or manually exit Training Mode by briefly holding down the **Stop** button.

### &#x20;**Check in to Earn**

Mystery Chest is a loot box that is dropped whenever you finished daily quests. It contains random NFT or PAL tokens. Each profile with a different level has different number of daily quests. Quests can be go to a restaurant or a bar, or riding with friends check in and share to Palmare Socialfi Network.

Mystery Chest has the same quality types as Bicycle. Upon receiving a Mystery Chest, opening the chest requires waiting and the countdown starts automatically. Once the countdown ends, they will be able to open it. Mystery Chest countdown duration increases proportionately to it
