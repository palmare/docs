# Bicycle

### Bicycle Attributes

1. **Strength (PAS Earning) – Single-Mode, Racing Mode**\
   ****In **Single Mode**, Efficiency plays a part in PAS earnings. Having a higher Efficiency Attribute will result in better PAS earnings per Energy spent.\
   In **Racing Mode**, higher Efficiency leads to a faster accumulation of Leaderboard points.\

2. **Luck (Mystery Chest) – Single-Mode, Bicycle Rental (Coming Soon)**\
   ****Luck determines the frequency and quality of a Mystery Chest drop. Users are also able to receive Mystery Chest drops while their Bicycles are leased out.\

3. **Dexterity (PAL Earning) – Single-Mode, Racing Mode, Staking/Governance (Under  Development)**\
   ****The Comfort value has been reworked and is currently under development.\

4.  **Endurance (Durability/Repair) – Single-Mode, Racing Mode**

    In **Single Mode**, Endurance affects the decay rate of Durability. Higher Endurance will result in a slower Durability decay. \
    \
    The higher the Bicycle's level of quality, the higher the repair cost. Endurance is a Bicycle's “stamina” bar. As a user moves, Endurance will decrease. Bicycles receive a “worn-out” penalty at 2 Durability touchpoints:

    1. At 50/100 Endurance, Bicycle Efficiency drops to 90%
    2. At 20/100 Endurance, Bicycle Efficiency drops to 10%

In **Racing Mode**, endurance will allow users to earn more points as their Bicycle will stay above the “worn-out” penalty mark longer.

**Users will be able to burn PAS/PAL to reset the Bicycle's Attribute points. The more frequent the reset, the more expensive it will be, with the cost capping at a certain level.**

### Bicycle Types

There are four Bicycle types, each designed to suit a different exercise intensity and/or fitness level:

| **Name**    | **Optimal Speed (km/hr)** | **Base Return at Optimal Speed** |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Casual**  | 5                         | 10  PAS / 1 Energy spent         |
| **Trainer** | 10                        | 15 PAS / 1 Energy spent          |
| **Warrior** | 20                        | 20 PAS / 1 Energy spent          |
| **Racer**   | 30                        | 25 PAS / 1 Energy spent          |

Users’ base PAS return is not static, and several factors may cause it to fluctuate:

1. Bicycle Efficiency (Low Durability affects Efficiency).
2. GPS signal - users will earn less if the GPS signal is poor.
3. Mobile Data signal strength and stability – if the data signal is choppy, it could also reduce earnings.
4. Randomization.

Information on PAL Return rates will be provided in future updates.

### Bicycle Quality

There are five Bicycle qualities. When a Bicycle is minted, the value of each Attribute will be chosen at random within the min. and max. values according to Bicycle quality. As such, even Bicycles of the same quality may have vastly different Attribute distributions.

| Quality       | Min. Attribute | Max. Attribute |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **Common**    | 1              | 3              |
| **Uncommon**  | 6              | 14             |
| **Rare**      | 15             | 35             |
| **Epic**      | 28             | 63             |
| **Legendary** | 45             | 95             |

### Bicycle Level

Users can level up their Bicycles by burning **PAS**. Each level-up takes a fixed time to complete, which increases along with the amount of **PAS** required according to the Bicycle level. This process can be sped up by using even more **PAS**.

Additionally, **PAL** will also be required to level a Bicycle to Level 29 and 30.

Upon level-up, users will attain 4 - 12 additional Attribute points to assign according to their Bicycle quality.

| Quality       | Attribute Point/Level up |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Common**    | 3                        |
| **Uncommon**  | 6                        |
| **Rare**      | 9                        |
| **Epic**      | 12                       |
| **Legendary** | 15                       |

### Bicycle **Customization (Under Development)**

At Level 30, users have the option of burning PAS/PAL/NFT to customize their Bicycles, including but not limited to - name changing, adding a quote, adding extra Attribute points, etc. More detail about customization will be released soon.
