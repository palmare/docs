# Bicycle



### Bicycle Types

There are four Bicycle types, each designed to suit a different exercise intensity and/or fitness level:

| **Name**    | **Optimal Speed (km/hr)** | **Base Return at Optimal Speed** |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Casual**  | 5                         | 10  PAS / 1 Energy spent         |
| **Trainer** | 10                        | 15 PAS / 1 Energy spent          |
| **Warrior** | 20                        | 20 PAS / 1 Energy spent          |
| **Racer**   | 30                        | 25 PAS / 1 Energy spent          |

Users’ base PAS return is not static, and several factors may cause it to fluctuate:

1. Bicycle Efficiency (Low Durability affects Efficiency).
2. GPS signal - users will earn less if the GPS signal is poor.
3. Mobile Data signal strength and stability – if the data signal is choppy, it could also reduce earnings.
4. Randomization.

Information on PAL Return rates will be provided in future updates.

### Bicycle Quality

There are five Bicycle qualities. When a Bicycle is minted, the value of each Attribute will be chosen at random within the min. and max. values according to Bicycle quality. As such, even Bicycles of the same quality may have vastly different Attribute distributions.

| Quality       | Min. Attribute | Max. Attribute |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **Common**    | 1              | 3              |
| **Uncommon**  | 6              | 14             |
| **Rare**      | 15             | 35             |
| **Epic**      | 28             | 63             |
| **Legendary** | 45             | 95             |

### Bicycle Level

Users can level up their Bicycles by burning **PAS**. Each level-up takes a fixed time to complete, which increases along with the amount of **PAS** required according to the Bicycle level. This process can be sped up by using even more **PAS**.

Additionally, **PAL** will also be required to level a Bicycle to Level 29 and 30.

Upon level-up, users will attain 4 - 12 additional Attribute points to assign according to their Bicycle quality.

| Quality       | Attribute Point/Level up |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Common**    | 3                        |
| **Uncommon**  | 6                        |
| **Rare**      | 9                        |
| **Epic**      | 12                       |
| **Legendary** | 15                       |

### Bicycle **Customization (Under Development)**

At Level 30, users have the option of burning PAS/PAL/NFT to customize their Bicycles, including but not limited to - name changing, adding a quote, adding extra Attribute points, etc. More detail about customization will be released soon.
