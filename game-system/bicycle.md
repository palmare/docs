# Bicycle

### Bicycle Attributes

1. **Efficiency (PAS Earning) – Solo Mode, Racing Mode**\
   ****In **Solo Mode**, Efficiency plays a part in PAS earnings. Having a higher Efficiency Attribute will result in better PAS earnings per Energy spent.\
   In **Racing Mode**, higher Efficiency leads to a faster accumulation of Leaderboard points.\

2. **Luck (Mystery Chest) – Solo Mode, Bicycle Rental (Coming Soon)**\
   ****Luck determines the frequency and quality of a Mystery Chest drop. Users are also able to receive Mystery Chest drops while their Bicycles are leased out.\

3. **Comfort (PAL Earning) – Solo Mode, Racing Mode, Staking/Governance (Under  Development)**\
   ****The Comfort value has been reworked and is currently under development.\

4.  **Resilience (Durability/Repair) – Solo Mode, Racing Mode**

    In **Solo Mode**, Resilience affects the decay rate of Durability. Higher Resilience will result in a slower Durability decay. \
    \
    The higher the Bicycle's level of quality, the higher the repair cost. Durability is a Bicycle's “stamina” bar. As a user moves, Durability will decrease. Bicycles receive a “worn-out” penalty at 2 Durability touchpoints:

    1. At 50/100 Durability, Bicycle Efficiency drops to 90%
    2. At 20/100 Durability, Bicycle Efficiency drops to 10%

In **Racing Mode**, resilience will allow users to earn more points as their Bicycle will stay above the “worn-out” penalty mark longer.

**Users will be able to burn PAS/PAL to reset the Bicycle's Attribute points. The more frequent the reset, the more expensive it will be, with the cost capping at a certain level (Under Development).**

### Bicycle Types

There are four Bicycle types, each designed to suit a different exercise intensity and/or fitness level:

| **Name**    | **Optimal Speed (km/hr)** | **Base Return at Optimal Speed** |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Casual**  | 1 - 6                     | 4 PAS / 1 Energy spent           |
| **Trainer** | 4 - 10                    | 5 PAS / 1 Energy spent           |
| **Warrior** | 8 - 20                    | 6 PAS / 1 Energy spent           |
| **Racer**   | 1 - 20                    | 4 - 6.25 PAS / 1 Energy spent    |

Users’ base PAS return is not static, and several factors may cause it to fluctuate:

1. Bicycle Efficiency (Low Durability affects Efficiency).
2. GPS signal - users will earn less if the GPS signal is poor.
3. Mobile Data signal strength and stability – if the data signal is choppy, it could also reduce earnings.
4. Randomization.

Information on PAL Return rates will be provided in future updates.

### Bicycle Quality

There are five Bicycle qualities. When a Bicycle is minted, the value of each Attribute will be chosen at random within the min. and max. values according to Bicycle quality. As such, even Bicycles of the same quality may have vastly different Attribute distributions.

| Quality       | Min. Attribute | Max. Attribute |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **Common**    | 1              | 10             |
| **Uncommon**  | 8              | 18             |
| **Rare**      | 15             | 35             |
| **Epic**      | 28             | 63             |
| **Legendary** | 50             | 112            |

### Bicycle Level

Users can level up their Bicycles by burning **PAS**. Each level-up takes a fixed time to complete, which increases along with the amount of **PAS** required according to the Bicycle level. This process can be speed up by using even more **PAS**.

Additionally, **PAL** will also be required to level a Bicycle to Level 29 and 30.

Upon level-up, users will attain 4 - 12 additional Attribute points to assign according to their Bicycle quality.

| Quality       | Attribute Point/Level up |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Common**    | 4                        |
| **Uncommon**  | 6                        |
| **Rare**      | 8                        |
| **Epic**      | 10                       |
| **Legendary** | 12                       |

Additional perks will be unlocked upon reaching certain level milestones:

| **Milestone** | **Triggered Event**            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Level 5**   | Unlocks Socket 1               |
| **Level 5**   | Unlocks Bike-minting           |
| **Level 10**  | Unlocks Bicycle Lease function |
| **Level 10**  | Unlocks Socket 2               |
| **Level 15**  | Unlocks Socket 3               |
| **Level 20**  | Unlocks Socket 4               |
| **Level 30**  | Unlocks PAL earning            |

**At max level, user need to choose between earning PAS or PAL. Switching between PAS/PAL earning is allowed, but will be subject to a cooldown duration.**&#x20;

&#x20;****&#x20;

### Bicycle **Customization (Under Development)**

At Level 30, users have the option of burning PAS/PAL/NFT to customize their Bicycles, including but not limited to - name changing, adding a quote, adding extra Attribute points, etc. More detail about customization will be released soon.
