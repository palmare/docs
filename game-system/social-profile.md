# SocialFi Profile

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Desktop - 9.png>)

The Profile NFT is the main object in the Palmare. It is ownership over this NFT that gives you control of your data and social content. Individual addresses own ProfileNFTs, and an address can contain multiple ProfileNFTs. The Profile NFT contains the history of all of the training data, posts, comments, and other content you generate.

Additionally, Profile NFTs contain a FollowModule. This module contains the logic that allows different accounts to be issued Follow NFTs to record their relationship to the main profile on-chain.

Profiles can only be minted by addresses that have been whitelisted by governance. This ensures that, given the low-fee environment present on BSC, the namespace is not reserved by squatters.
