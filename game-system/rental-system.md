![](<../.gitbook/assets/Desktop - 8.png>)

In order for the bicycle rental system to operate smoothly, it is necessary to have NFT renters and NFT stakers.

For those who own nft Bicycles but do not have time to use them regularly, they can staking nft to earn on Palmare app with attractive interest rates. Interest rates will be paid in PAS and vary based on Bicycle's Attribute and Rarity.

Renters can access the market place, rent all staking nfts to ride to earn. Nft once rented will be locked in the app and will not be exchanged until the lease expires. 20% of the reward renters earn from Ride to Earn will be transferred back to the pool to pay interest to the NFT Stakers and PAL-BNB LP providers.
