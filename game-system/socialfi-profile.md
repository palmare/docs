### SocialFi Profile

We create an AR Geo-game mode that cyclists can join in a mission every day hunting for hidden in their biking route. Cyclists explore their real-world area searching for :key2:Gold Keys, which are then used to open Loot Box.&#x20;

When a box is opened the user is prompted with a trivia question about your geographical history. If answered correctly within the given time limit, the user is rewarded with Scholar Point that can redeem for a real-life prize.&#x20;
