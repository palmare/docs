# Overview

The introduction of the Move to Earn app has redefined the fitness industry. Based on this success, we decided to make the Palmare app based on researching and optimizing the Earning system and bringing a new experience to the sports community. **Palmare is a Community-owned Web3 Sports App with an inbuilt Social-Fi and Burn to Earn element**.\


It empowers the sports community to own the links between themselves and their communities, forming a fully composable, user-owned social graph. The built-in protocol ensures immutable content owned by users and social relationships. The problem of Web2 social is all read from their unique, centralized database. There is no portability. Your profile, followers, and content are locked to a specific network and owned by the network operator.\


In Palmare, each user profile is a token itself. Users create a profile on the app, for which they will mint an ID'd profile NFT. This NFT controls the profile, and thus, its owner becomes the controller of the given profile.



Our app will provide social graph and earning features for Crypto fans and Non-crypto Users. We focus on three types of Earning:

* **Ride & Burn to Earn** each sport you participate in can help you earn by burning calories (for riding a bike or any of your favorite sports)
* **Engage to Earn** users contribute content to the sports community and earn back from social engagement (include like, share, follow...)
* **Check in to Earn** While users are riding, they can check in lots of places they came by, and for each period of time, We have quests for users to check in as much as they can to earn tokens.

> _Note: Palmare is currently under Developing Phase, so contents in the Whitepaper could be changed in the future._
