# Overview

**Palmare is a Web3 Sport App with inbuilt Game-Fi and Ride to Earn element**

**Palmare** is built around an essential daily activity for most people – moving around. We are the first project to effectively bring to life a functioning ride & earn concept.

Users equip themselves with NFTs in the form of Bicycle. By casual riding around or professional racing, users will earn game currency, which can either be used in-game, or cashed out for profit.

With Game-Fi, **Palmare** aims to nudge millions toward a healthier lifestyle, combat climate change and connect the public to Web 3.0, all while simultaneously hinging on it’s Social-Fi aspect to build a long-lasting platform fostering user generated Web 3.0 content.

> _Note: Palmare is currently under Developing Phase, so contents in the Whitepaper could be changed in the future._
