# Overview

The introduction of the Stepn app ushered in the Move to Earn movement that has redefined the fitness industry. Based on this success, we decided to make the Palmare app based on researching and optimizing the earning system and bringing a new experience to the cyclist users.\
\
**Palmare is a Community-first Web3 Sport App with inbuilt Game-Fi and Ride to Earn element**

**Palmare** is built around an essential daily activity for most people – moving around. We are the first project to effectively bring to life a functioning ride & earn concept.

Users equip themselves with NFTs in the form of Bicycle. By casual riding around or professional racing, users will earn game currency, which can either be used in-game, or cashed out for profit.

Our app will provide not only a primary measurement tool but also very special features for Crypto fans and Non-crypto Users. We focus on three types of Earning:

* **Ride to earn** (for riding a bike and how far and fast users can go to earn token)
* **Burn to earn** (or do exercise to earn, users do exercise to burn calories and energy in order to reach the target to earn token)
* **Check in to earn** (While users are riding, they can check in lots of places they came by, and for each period of time, We have quests for users to check in as much as they can to earn token)

With Game-Fi, **Palmare** aims to nudge millions toward a healthier lifestyle, combat climate change and connect the public to Web 3.0, all while simultaneously hinging on it’s Social-Fi aspect to build a long-lasting platform fostering user generated Web 3.0 content.

> _Note: Palmare is currently under Developing Phase, so contents in the Whitepaper could be changed in the future._
