# IPO (Initial Phase Offering)

**By Cyclist, for Cyclist.** Palmare is a community-first Web3 project, so we decided no VC power! All 24.2% of the $PAL issued will be allocated to the community over 40 phases. The value of each $PAL will increase at each phase of the IPO. The sale will close on Oct 28, 2022. The hard cap is $20M, with the balance of tokens released on Pancake Swap.&#x20;

If the deadline is met, 3% of tokens will be released on Pancake Swap at the last phase price. The remaining tokens that have not been purchased will be :fire:**Burned** to prevent dilution for early investors.



### **Token Release Schedule**

**Initial Phase Offering** Purchased token is vested in 3 - 18 months. After each ten rounds end, participants can swap $PAL for $BUSD at the latest price with specific liquidity. For example, after round 10th end, users can access a 220,000 BUSD pool and swap $PAL at a $0.0403 price.
