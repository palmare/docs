# IPO (Initial Phase Offering)

Palmare is a community-first Web3 project, so we decided **no VC power!** All 24.2% of the $PAL issued will be allocated to the community over 40 phases. The value of each $PAL will increase at each phase of the IPO. The sale will close 3 months after 1st round end.&#x20;

If the deadline is met, 3% of tokens will be released on Pancake Swap at the last phase price. The remaining tokens that have not been purchased will be :fire:**Burned** to prevent dilution for early investors.



### **Token Release Schedule**

After purchasing the $PAL token, you get instantly a portion of the purchased token and the rest will be distributed following the vesting schedule. Each purchaser can get a different tier based on the round number they joined.\


**Initial Phase Offering** Purchased $PAL token is vested in 6 - 15 months. After each 5 rounds end, participants can swap $PAL for $BUSD at the latest price with specific liquidity. For example, after round 5th end, users can access a 220,000 BUSD pool and swap $PAL at a $0.0248 price.
