**PAL Vesting Mechanics**

47.8% of total PAL will be distributed to users through Ride & Earn and Governance participation. To ensure the longevity of the Palmare project, the total release of PAL will halve every two years.

The purchased token will be unlocked 10% at TGE and vested 30% each 3 months.

The airdrop token will be unlocked after the public sale end.
