# Public Sale

We are issuing 1 Billion $PAL as a BEP20 token on the Binance Smart Chain. 24.2% of the $PAL issued will be allocated to the community over 40 phases. The value of each $PAL will increase at each phase of the Public Sale. The sale will close on Sep 28, 2022. The hard cap is $20M, with the balance of tokens to be released on Pancake Swap.&#x20;

If a phase is not achieved, then 3% of tokens will be released on Pancake Swap at the last phase price. The remaining tokens that have not been purchased will be :fire: burned to prevent dilution for early investors.
